/*
In this exercise, you will write a statement 
using cout  and the insertion operator <<  to display how many dogs Sally has.  

The variable x  represents the number of dogs. 

x  has already been declared and initialized for you.

The output should read "Sally has 3 dogs.". 

For this exercise, there is NO need to use the '\n '  character or endl  
to create a new line after the output statement.

Note: only a single cout statement is required for this exercise. 
No other code should be necessary.
